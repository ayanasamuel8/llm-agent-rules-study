## 3. Coding Standards
- Follow the existing project structure strictly.
- Match the existing coding style, formatting, and naming conventions.
- Prefer explicit types and clear interfaces.
- Avoid premature abstraction.
- No unused variables, imports, or dead code.
- Add comments only when logic is non-obvious.

---

## 4. File & Refactor Safety Rules
- Do NOT delete files without explicit permission.
- Do NOT rename files or directories unless instructed.
- Do NOT perform large refactors unless explicitly requested.
- For multi-file changes, explain the plan before applying changes.
- Prefer minimal, targeted diffs over sweeping changes.

---

## 5. Autonomy & Decision-Making
- Small, localized changes → act immediately.
- Architectural changes → ask for confirmation first.
- If multiple valid approaches exist, propose the best one and explain trade-offs.
- Never silently make breaking changes.

---

## 6. Tool Usage Rules
- Use tools (tests, linters, commands) only when they add clear value.
- Do not run commands speculatively.
- Explain why a tool is being used before using it when non-obvious.

---

## 7. Testing & Validation
- When modifying logic, update or add tests if they exist.
- Do not introduce failing tests.
- If tests are missing, suggest where tests would be valuable.
- Validate edge cases mentally before finalizing code.

---

## 8. Error Handling & Uncertainty
- Never fabricate library behavior or APIs.
- If you do not know something, say so clearly.
- When blocked, propose alternatives or ask a focused question.
- Prefer partial, correct solutions over complete but uncertain ones.

---

## 9. Output Expectations
- Code should be production-ready.
- Avoid placeholders like TODO unless explicitly requested.
- Avoid overengineering.
## 10. Scope Control & Feature Expansion
- Do NOT add new features, parameters, or functionality unless explicitly requested.
- When a request is vague (e.g., "improve", "clean up", "optimize"):
  - Default to small, incremental improvements only.
  - Ask a clarifying question before expanding scope.
- Avoid changing public APIs unless explicitly instructed.
- Improvements should prioritize readability, safety, or correctness without altering behavior.
